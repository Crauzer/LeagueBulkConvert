# LeagueBulkConvert
Easily convert champion models from League of Legends to glTF.

## How do I use it?
1. Extract the .zip file
2. Run LeagueBulkConvert.exe (I'll work on building to a single file, even if it will slow down the first start-up)
3. Select your League of Legends installation directory (for example, C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)
4. Select an output directory
5. Optionally edit the config file (I'll provide more information on this format soon, for now you can send me a message on Discord: Jochem#4611)
6. Click convert (and wait)

## Troubleshooting
Since very few people have used this program so far and since I've not experienced any issues during my testing, I don't really have anything to put here.

* You need to be connected to the internet to use this program, since it downloads textfiles from GitHub
* You should select an empty directory for the converted files, since the program automatically creates and deletes entire directories recursively.
* If you include the animations, you probably also want the hidden meshes (hidden meshes include the recall meshes)
