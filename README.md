# LeagueBulkConvert
Easily convert champion models from League of Legends to glTF.

## How do I use it?
1. Extract the .zip file
2. Run LeagueBulkConvert.exe (I'll work on building to a single file, even if it will slow down the first start-up)
3. Select your League of Legends installation directory (for example, C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)
4. Select an output directory
5. Optionally edit the config file
6. Click convert (and wait)

## TODO
I still need to add support for writing the skeleton (this is only a couple lines of code) and support for writing the animations (this is slightly more complicated). This should hopefully happen very quickly.
